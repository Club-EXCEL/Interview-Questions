String S with length N is provided to you. You have to choose a non-empty substring
of S such that each character occurs even number of times in this substring and erase 
this substring from S. (The parts of S before and after the erased substring are concatenated and the
 next operation is performed on this shorter string.)
For example, from the string "acabbad", we can erase the highlighted substring "abba", 
since each character occurs an even number of times in this substring. After this operation,
 the remaining string is "acd".
Is it possible to erase the whole string using one or more operations?

Note: A string B is a substring of a string A if B can be obtained from 
A by deleting several (possibly none or all) characters from the beginning 
and several (possibly none or all) characters from the end.


INPUT
1.The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
2.The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
3.The second line contains a single string S with length N.

OUTPUT
For each test case, print a single line containing the string "YES" if it is possible to erase the whole string or "NO" otherwise (without quotes).

Constraints
1≤T≤200
1≤N≤1,000
S contains only lowercase English letters
