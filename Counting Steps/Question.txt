Aryan loves morning walk with his brother. He likes to cover K feet in one step.
However this leads to a problem as he cannot cover certain distances, i.e. if he
is covering 3 feet in a single step, he cannot travel the distance of exactly 8 feet.
There are N number of distances and feet K which he covers in a single step.
Your task is to find out which distance he can not tracel;

Input:
1. First line contains single integer T(no. of test cases)
2. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers - N & K
3. The second line of each test case contains N no. of Distances D[i] (from D[0] to D[n-1])

constraints:
1<=T,N<=1000
1<=K,D[i]<=10^9

Output:
For each testcase print a string consisting of N characters, ith character should be 1
if the distance is traversable and 0 if not.

Sample Input:
3
4 5
12 14 16 17
5 7
7 14 21 22 0
1 4
6

Sample output:
0000
11101
